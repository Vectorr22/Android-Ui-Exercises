# UI Exercises &mdash; Hands-on Exercises for Android


## About Android-Ui-Exercises

This repository is a collection of UI exercises I developed, inspired by the work and videos of UI Designer Anna Happon, to sharpen my Android design skills. Each exercise represents a hands-on approach to exploring various UI components and layouts, allowing me to experiment with design concepts and improve my ability to build clean, responsive interfaces.
 

### What You Will Find in Egg:
